## Codex Notes

- Treat references like /team-audio or /other-skill as Codex skill names. For example, use $team-audio for this workflow.
- Treat AGENTS.md as the project coordination doc and combine it with relevant repo docs under docs/.
- Ask concise follow-up questions directly in chat instead of relying on Claude-only question tools.
- Treat specialized role names from the source repo as conceptual guidance. Work locally by default, and only use generic Codex subagents if the user explicitly asks for delegation.
- Shared imported templates live under ../_game-studio-shared/templates/.
- Use docs/technical-preferences.md as the project-level technical preferences file. Seed it from ../_game-studio-shared/templates/technical-preferences.md if needed.

When this skill is invoked, orchestrate the audio team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** At each step transition, use `a concise direct user question` to present
the user with the draft proposals as selectable options. Write the
full analysis in conversation, then capture the decision with concise labels.
The user must approve before moving to the next step.

1. **Read the argument** for the target feature or area (e.g., `combat`,
   `main menu`, `forest biome`, `boss encounter`).

2. **Gather context**:
   - Read relevant design docs in `design/gdd/` for the feature
   - Read the sound bible at `design/gdd/sound-bible.md` if it exists
   - Read existing audio asset lists in `assets/audio/`
   - Read any existing sound design docs for this area

## How to Delegate

If the user explicitly wants delegation, map each team member below to a suitable generic Codex subagent:
- `role: audio-director` -- Sonic identity, emotional tone, audio palette
- `role: sound-designer` -- SFX specifications, audio events, mixing groups
- `role: technical-artist` -- Audio middleware, bus structure, memory budgets
- `role: gameplay-programmer` -- Audio manager, gameplay triggers, adaptive music

Always provide full context in each subagent prompt (feature description, existing audio assets, design doc references).

3. **Orchestrate the audio team** in sequence:

### Step 1: Audio Direction (audio-director)
If the user explicitly wants delegation, spawn a suitable generic Codex subagent for the `audio-director` pass to:
- Define the sonic identity for this feature/area
- Specify the emotional tone and audio palette
- Set music direction (adaptive layers, stems, transitions)
- Define audio priorities and mix targets
- Establish any adaptive audio rules (combat intensity, exploration, tension)

### Step 2: Sound Design (sound-designer)
If the user explicitly wants delegation, spawn a suitable generic Codex subagent for the `sound-designer` pass to:
- Create detailed SFX specifications for every audio event
- Define sound categories (ambient, UI, gameplay, music, dialogue)
- Specify per-sound parameters (volume range, pitch variation, attenuation)
- Plan audio event list with trigger conditions
- Define mixing groups and ducking rules

### Step 3: Technical Implementation (technical-artist)
If the user explicitly wants delegation, spawn a suitable generic Codex subagent for the `technical-artist` pass to:
- Design the audio middleware integration (Wwise/FMOD/native)
- Define audio bus structure and routing
- Specify memory budgets for audio assets per platform
- Plan streaming vs preloaded asset strategy
- Design any audio-reactive visual effects

### Step 4: Code Integration (gameplay-programmer)
If the user explicitly wants delegation, spawn a suitable generic Codex subagent for the `gameplay-programmer` pass to:
- Implement audio manager system or review existing
- Wire up audio events to gameplay triggers
- Implement adaptive music system (if specified)
- Set up audio occlusion/reverb zones
- Write unit tests for audio event triggers

4. **Compile the audio design document** combining all team outputs.

5. **Save to** `design/gdd/audio-[feature].md`.

6. **Output a summary** with: audio event count, estimated asset count,
   implementation tasks, and any open questions between team members.
